In order to study the warmup effect:


1. have separate kernels for each of the tracking functions with just one switch case inside each.
   
   First call only one of them at a time.
   Time each of these kernels and keep their timing values in a vector to study the warmup effect.
   Then call them one after the other in a sequence.
   Have only 250 beam elements.

2. have one consolidated kernel with all tracking functions.
   
   Call the kernel multiple times and store the time values for each of them.
   There would be 250 beam elements of each type.

3. in the case where the switch case is moved out of the kernel

   First call only one kernel at a time, with 250 beam elements
   Time each of the kernels and keep their timing values in a vector to study the warmup effect.
   Then call each of them all of them. Time those as well.


Pass the number of turns as a command line argument aloong with the number of particles.
Adjust the number of turns such that for certain number of particles, the time of execution is appreciable.


For the purpose of plotting, plot the exection time for particles in the range 1000 -- 100000 separately and for 10000 -- 25000000 separately
